# NES Matrix Screensaver

NES Matrix Screensaver is a project that recreates
the iconic "Matrix code rain" effect on an NES console.
Using 6502 assembly language, this project displays cascading characters
on the screen, mimicking the famous visual effect from the movie "The Matrix".

## Prerequisites

- [CC65](https://cc65.github.io/) - The assembler used to compile the NES
assembly code.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TheVaultdweller13/nes-matrix-screensaver
    ```

2. **Compile the code:**
    There are two methods provided for compiling the code: using a batch script
    for Windows or a Makefile for Unix-based systems.

    **Windows:**
    - Make sure to add CC65 to the path
    - Run the `compile.bat` script:

        ```sh
        compile.bat
        ```

    **Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):**
    - Ensure `make` is installed on your system.
    - Run the following command to compile and build the ROM:

        ```sh
        make
        ```

3. **Run the compiled ROM:**
    Use your preferred NES emulator to run the `main.nes` file generated by the
    assembler.
