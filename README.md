# NES Hello World

This project is a sort of "Hello World" written in NES (MOS 6502) assembly, featuring some sounds, movements, and simple functions. It serves as a testing ground for anyone learning (myself included!) to program in NES assembly, and looking for something small yet functional to work with.

## Prerequisites

- [NESASM3](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm) - The assembler used to compile the NES assembly code.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TheVaultdweller13/NESHelloWorld
    ```

2. **Compile the code:**
    There are two methods provided for compiling the code: using a batch script for Windows or a Makefile for Unix-based systems.

    **Windows:**
    - Run the `compile.bat` script:
        ```sh
        compile.bat
        ```

    **Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):**
    - Ensure `make` is installed on your system.
    - Run the following command to compile and build the ROM:
        ```sh
        make
        ```

3. **Run the compiled ROM:**
    Use your preferred NES emulator to run the `main.nes` file generated by the assembler.
